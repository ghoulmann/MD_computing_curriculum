Keyboarding Lessons: Divergent Models from Reliable Sources
***********************************************************

Resource: ByteBack
==================

Lesson 1: Left Hand & Home Row
------------------------------

This lesson teaches the four left keys of the home row. Place your index finger on F, middle finger on D, ring finger on S, and pinky on A. Your thumb goes on the space bar. However, leave your right hand on the homerow as well to get used to having both hands on the keyboard.

This is your first lesson so go slow and try to get fewer than five errors and faster than 20 words per minute (WPM).

Spend a minute memorizing the finger positions, and then keep your eyes on the exercise and not on your hands. And don't forget good posture!

Lesson 2: Right Hand & Home Row
-------------------------------

This lesson teaches the right four keys of the home row. Your index finger goes on J, middle finger on K, ring finger on L, and pinky on ;. Again, leave both hands on the keyboard with your thumbs on the space bar.

Just like the first lesson, go slow and concentrate on accuracy! And no peeking at your fingers either!

Lesson 3: Both Hands, Home Row
------------------------------

Now it's time to combine the first two lessons. Remember to keep your fingers on the home row. This is a large lesson, using almost an entire row of keys so go at your own pace.

Remember the work you did in the previous two lessons!
