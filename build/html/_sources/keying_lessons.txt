Keyboarding Lessons: Divergent Models from Reliable Sources
***********************************************************

Resource: ByteBack
==================

Lesson 1: Left Hand & Home Row
------------------------------

This lesson teaches the four left keys of the home row. Place your index finger on F, middle finger on D, ring finger on S, and pinky on A. Your thumb goes on the space bar. However, leave your right hand on the homerow as well to get used to having both hands on the keyboard.

This is your first lesson so go slow and try to get fewer than five errors and faster than 20 words per minute (WPM).

Spend a minute memorizing the finger positions, and then keep your eyes on the exercise and not on your hands. And don't forget good posture!

Lesson 2: Right Hand & Home Row
-------------------------------

This lesson teaches the right four keys of the home row. Your index finger goes on J, middle finger on K, ring finger on L, and pinky on ;. Again, leave both hands on the keyboard with your thumbs on the space bar.

Just like the first lesson, go slow and concentrate on accuracy! And no peeking at your fingers either!

Lesson 3: Both Hands, Home Row
------------------------------

Now it's time to combine the first two lessons. Remember to keep your fingers on the home row. This is a large lesson, using almost an entire row of keys so go at your own pace.

Remember the work you did in the previous two lessons!

Lesson 4: Home Row with G and H
-------------------------------

This is the last lesson for the home row! The G and H keys are typed with the index finger on each hand and are the first "reaches" you will learn. G is typed by reaching the right index finger while H is typed with the left. Make sure to return your fingers when you are done with each reach, and try to move your other fingers as little as possible during another fingers' reach.

After this lesson, you will have learned an entire row of the keyboard!

Lesson 5: E and I
-----------------

So that you can quickly begin typing many words, it's time to learn some more vowels! I and E are typed by reaching the middle finger of each hand to the top row.

Remember to return to home row position after each reach!

Lesson 6: R and U
-----------------

When typing, your index fingers do the most work. Now we will learn two more reaches for your index fingers. R and U are typed by reaching the index finger of each hand up to the top row. Always return your fingers to the correct home row positions.

Now you know over half the letters!

Lesson 7: T and Y
-----------------

Continuing with the index fingers, it is time to learn T and Y. T and Y are typed by reaching the index fingers up to the top row. Now you will know enough letters to spell a wide variety of words.

Remember, you can repeat lessons as many times as you want and even return to old lessons to review!

Lesson 8: B and N
-----------------

It's time to move down to the bottom row. B and N are typed with the index finger of each hand. Remember to return your fingers to the correct home row position. Now only one reach remains for the index fingers.

Accuracy first!

Lesson 9: V and M
-----------------

Now its time to learn the last reaches for your index fingers. To type V and M, reach your index finger down, remembering to replace your fingers on the home row after each reach.

Keep up the good work!

Lesson 10: W and O
------------------

Lesson 11: Q and P
------------------

Here we will finish the top row! P and Q are typed with the pinky of each hand. The pinky is often one of the hardest fingers to use, so take your time and make sure you are comfortable using both, because P is a commonly used letter!

Make sure you are using all the correct reaches!

Lesson 12: C and Comma (,)
--------------------------

This is an important lesson because C is a very common letter and the comma (,) is your first punctuation mark. The C and , are typed by curling the middle fingers down to the bottom row of keys.

C is one of the hardest reaches to learn. Doing this will be awkward at first, so make sure you are comfortable with C and comma before you move on!

Lesson 13: Z, X, and Period (.)
-------------------------------

This may be the hardest lesson because you are working with uncommon letters. This makes is even more important, however, because you will not get as much practice with them! Z is typed by curling the left pinky down a row, X is typed by curling the left ring finger down a row, and period is typed with the right ring finger.

Take your time and concentrate on using the correct reaches! This exercise may be slower than many of the earlier ones.

Lesson 14: The Shift Key
------------------------

Letters are important, but to actually type, it is important to know the shift key! The shift key, a type of "modifier" key, capitalizes letters or shifts a key to its secondary symbol.

To use the shift key, hold the shift key down with the pinky of the opposite hand of the letter you are typing. Make sure that when you type the letter down, the shift key is held down. Make sure to release the shift key before typing another key!

Make sure you practice using both shift keys!

Lesson 15: ? and !
------------------

You can already punctuate your sentences, but now itss time to add some expression. Exclamation point and the question mark are the secondary uses of their keys, meaning that you must hold the shift key while typing them. For ! hold the shift key with your right pinky while reaching up to the 1(!) key in the number row with your left pinky. To type ? hold shift with the left pinky while reaching down to the /(?) key with your right pinky.

Once you master these, you're ready for the final test!

Fun Fact: An exclamation point followed by a question mark is technically called an "interrobang." It looks like this: . A reverse and upside-down interrobang is called a "gnaborretni" ("interrobang" backwards).

Final Assessment
----------------

You have now completed all 15 lessons and are ready for the final test! However, you can still take the Advanced Lessons to learn more punctuation, symbols, and numbers, or use the Extra Exercises for more practice. The more you type, the more your speed and accuracy will improve! Additionally, you'll find more tests, exercises, lessons, and even games on the Resources page.

Congratulations!
