Computing Curriculum
====================

I've been charged with teaching, as I understand it, a software applications course for 5-8th graders. I have only vague information; it sounds like it's one period a week.

As it has some relevance - the audience is a population of students whose literacy can be pretty severely impacted by their language-based learning differences.

I've tried to work without proprietary language in this stub of a curriculum.

Collaboration welcome. I'm working in reStructeredText with Sphinx. The html is rendered at http://badsville.ignorelist.com/md_computing/.
